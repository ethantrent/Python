Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

At the beginning of the semester I couldn't grasp the concepts of functions as we briefly learned in CSE110. I began to understand their purpose and it
helped me better understand how usefult they are, especially being reusable for others. The water flow assignment was a great example of how programs
can be used to make something more simplistic and easier to write, while being reusable.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

In my opinion, test functions make the process of ensuring the function is working properly. They set up a specific scenario, 
execute the code being tested, and then assert whether the actual outcome matches the expected outcome.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

The first thing I would do is use the debugger tool. It's always my go to when troubleshooting an error. I would see if I could catch
anything with just looking at the program, but the debugger would help me make sure I can find any errors or problems within the program.
One thing I could do to improve my process is by ensuring everything was coded in correctly before going in with the debugger, especially if
it is a simple error. Then, if I couldn't figure out I would go through with debugger to understand where the mistake is happening.
